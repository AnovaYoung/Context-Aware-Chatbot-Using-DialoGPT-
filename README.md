**Data Loading and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Overview

In this section, I will focus on loading the Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus from the specified path and performing a comprehensive EDA. The goal is to understand the dataset's structure, content, and characteristics to inform subsequent data preprocessing and model training steps.

**Objectives**

Data Extraction: Unzip and load the dataset files into usable data structures.

Data Understanding: Gain insights into the dataset by exploring its components.

Identify Issues: Detect any anomalies, missing values, or inconsistencies.

Inform Preprocessing: Use findings to refine our data preprocessing strategy.

**Dataset Details**

Path to Dataset: /content/_Cornellmoviecorpus.zip

Key Files:

movie_lines.txt: Contains individual lines of dialogue.

movie_conversations.txt: Defines the conversations by listing sequences of line IDs.
Steps

**1. Data Loading**
Unzip the Dataset:

Extract the contents of _Cornellmoviecorpus.zip to access the dataset files.

Read Data Files:

movie_lines.txt:

Load into a suitable data structure (e.g., Pandas DataFrame or dictionary).

Fields to extract:
Line ID (lineID)
Character ID (characterID)
Movie ID (movieID)
Character Name (character)
Utterance Text (text)

movie_conversations.txt:
Load into a data structure that maps conversations.

Fields to extract:

Character 1 ID
Character 2 ID
Movie ID
List of Utterance IDs

**2. Data Mapping and Merging**

Create Line Dictionary:
Map each lineID to its corresponding text.

Construct Conversations:

Use the list of lineIDs in movie_conversations.txt to build conversations.

Each conversation will be a sequence of utterances mapped from lineIDs to text.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis**

3.1. Understanding Conversation Structures

Conversation Lengths:

Analyze the number of exchanges per conversation.

Compute statistics:

Total Conversations: Number of conversations in the dataset.

Average Length: Average number of exchanges per conversation.

Distribution: Frequency distribution of conversation lengths.

3.2. Character and Movie Analysis
Most Active Characters:

Identify characters with the most lines.

Character Interactions:
Analyze which character pairs have the most conversations.

Movie Distribution:
Determine how dialogues are distributed across different movies.

3.3. Utterance Analysis
Utterance Lengths:

Calculate the length of each utterance in terms of words and characters.

Analyze the distribution of utterance lengths.

Vocabulary Analysis:
Build a vocabulary of all unique words.

Identify the most frequent words and phrases.

Compute vocabulary size.

3.4. Data Quality Checks

Missing Values:
Check for any missing or null values in movie_lines.txt and movie_conversations.txt.

Duplicate Entries:
Identify any duplicate lines or conversations.

Language Consistency:
Ensure all utterances are in English.

Special Characters and Encoding:
Detect any unusual characters or encoding issues.

**4. Visualization**

Conversation Lengths:
Plot a histogram to visualize the distribution of conversation lengths.

Utterance Lengths:
Create a histogram or box plot of utterance lengths.


Word Frequency:
Generate a word cloud of the most frequent words.

Character Activity:
Bar chart showing the top characters by the number of lines spoken.

Interaction Networks (Optional):
Visualize character interactions using network graphs.
